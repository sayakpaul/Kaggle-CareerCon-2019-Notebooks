But how can we take a model we've trained in one place and apply it in another? By saving the model and then loading it into a new environment. \n",

You could create an API that trains models, but you will probably have to end up having to pay for the compute used to train those models. This can become expensive. Particularly since I'm not covering how to do authentication, which means anyone would be able to train as many models as they wanted with your API, **I'd recommend avoiding including model training in your API.** I'm assuming going forward that your API will use a pretrained model.\n",

    "\n",
    "* For *TensorFlow* and *Keras*, you can save models using `model.save_weights()` and read it in using `model.load_weights()`. By default, your model will be saved as a HDF5 file. You can find [more information on tf here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_restore_models#manually_save_weights) and [more on Keras here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html). .\n",
    "* For *PyTorch* you can use `torch.save()` and `torch.load()`. PyTorch saves models as pickles. [More info here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html). \n",
    "* For *XGBoost*, you can save models with `model.dump_model()` and load them with `model.load_model()`. [More info here](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html#training).\n",
    "* For *LightGBM*, you can use `model_to_string()` and `model_from_string()`. [More info here](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-API.html#lightgbm.Booster.model_from_string). \n",
    "\n",
    "### If there's no library-specific technique\n",
    "\n",
    "If the library you're using doesn't have a specific method for saving out models, probably the easiest choice is to save your model as a pickle. [Pickles are a serialized data format for Python](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), which means you can read them directly into your current environment as variables. If your model is built as one or more numpy arrays, [you may be able to use HDF5 instead](https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/blog/2016/04/27/h5py-intro.html), but pickles can handle more different data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🥒 A quick warning about pickles 🥒** You should be aware that if there are differences between the version or subversion of Python you used to pickle your model and the one you try to unpickle it with, you model can fail to load. (This is also true of packages with different versions!) To avoid this, you can specify the specific versions of Python and each package you used when you create your app in your requirements file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**🥒🥒 A second quick warning about pickles 🥒🥒** While they can be useful for moving Python objects around, it’s also not a very secure file format. [As the Python wiki puts it:](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle) “Pickle files can be hacked. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, don't trust it! It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary python when you try to de-pickle it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Flashtext module doesn’t have a native way to save a load objects (at least that I can find), so I’ll save my keyword processor as a pickle using the pickle library. \n"
