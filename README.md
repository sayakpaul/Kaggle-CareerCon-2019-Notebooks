Notebooks presented by [Rachael Tatman](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman) during [Kaggle CareerCon 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/careercon2019). The notebooks cover the basics of REST APIs, how to wrap an ML model into a REST API and how to deploy that API on Heroku and GCP's AppEngine. 

The notebooks have been collected from Rachael's Kaggle profile and all of them have been prepared by Rachael herself.
